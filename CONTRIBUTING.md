# Building and releasing

## How to build the Google BigQuery data source plugin locally

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed first:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (see [go.mod](../go.mod#L3) for minimum required version)
- [Mage](https://magefile.org/)
- [Node.js (Long Term Support)](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

## Frontend

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install --pure-lockfile
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode or run in watch mode

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn watch
   ```

3. Build plugin in production mode

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

## Backend

1. Build the backend binaries

   ```bash
   mage -v
   ```

## Build a release for the Google BigQuery data source plugin

You need to have commit rights to the GitHub repository to publish a release.

1. Update the version number in the `package.json` file.
2. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes contained in the release.
3. Commit the changes to `main` branch and push to GitHub.
4. Create a tag locally that follows the convention v(major).(minor).x, leaving the patch as `x`. For example:

   ```bash
   git tag v3.3.0
   ```

5. Push the new tag to GitHub

   ```bash
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

6. Follow the Drone release process that you can find [here](https://github.com/grafana/integrations-team/wiki/Plugin-Release-Process#drone-release-process)

# Plugin Technical Documentation

## Authentication

The [grafana-google-sdk-go](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-google-sdk-go) package is currently used by Google BigQuery data source plugin to provide a unified authentication for Google data sources.

## Architecture

The idiomatic way to use a SQL, or SQL-like, database in Go is through the [database/sql package](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/). The sql package provides a generic interface around SQL databases. One main benefit of using this pattern for data fetching is that we are reusing building blocks from other SQL-like data source plugins in Grafana.

### grafana/sqlds and sqlutil

From the [sqlds](https://github.com/grafana/sqlds) readme:

_sqlds stands for SQL Datasource._

_Most SQL-driven datasources, like Postgres, MySQL, and MSSQL share extremely similar codebases._

_The sqlds package is intended to remove the repetition of these datasources and centralize the datasource logic. The only thing that the datasources themselves should have to define is connecting to the database, and what driver to use, and the plugin frontend._

Furthermore, sqlds allows each datasource to implement its own fillmode, macros and string converters.

Internally, sqlds is using [sqlutil](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go/tree/master/data/sqlutil) which is a package in `grafana-plugin-sdk-go`. `sqlutil` exposes utility functions for converting database/sql rows into data frames.

### Google BigQuery driver

The database/sql package can only be used in conjunction with a database driver.

This plugin implements our own sql driver based on https://github.com/solcates/go-sql-bigquery driver.
